# Spring Boot Subscription Platform

A modular, microservices-based SaaS platform built with Spring Boot 3.5.4 and Spring Cloud 2023.x. This system allows users to register, manage their own subdomain-based sites, choose subscription plans, and access features based on role-based permissions.

## 🧱 Project Modules

| Module             | Description | Status |

| `user-service`     | Manages users, profiles, roles, permissions, and referral/invite codes | Planned |
| `site-service`     | Manages customer sites (subdomains), ownership, and multi-tenant logic | Planned |
| `subscription-service` | Handles subscription plans, active plans, history, billing, etc. | Planned |
| `config-service`   | Centralized Spring Cloud Config Server (Git-backed) | Available |
| `gateway-service`  | API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway + route-based authentication | Planned |
| `discovery-service`| Eureka server for service discovery | Available |
| `audit-log-service`| Tracks and stores all important user/system actions | Planned |
| `settings-service` | Platform-wide configuration and environment flags | Planned |

## 🚀 Development Plan

### ✅ Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Create parent Maven project (`spring-boot-subscription-platform`)
- [x] Add `auth-service` as module
- [x] Create and register `config-service`
- [x] Add `discovery-service` (Eureka)
- [ ] Implement Docker Compose to launch all services locally

### 🧩 Phase 2: Core Features
- [x] Generate `auth-service` via Spring Initializr
- [ ] Configure Config Server and connect `auth-service`
- [ ] Implement login, register, password hashing, JWT generation
- [ ] Add role & permission model
- [ ] Implement global error handling, validation, Swagger

### 🧑‍💼 Phase 3: User & Tenant Services
- [ ] Create `user-service` and link with `auth-service`
- [ ] Build `site-service` to manage subdomains & ownership
- [ ] Add user-site assignment logic
- [ ] Start `subscription-service` with plan models and history tracking

### 📊 Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement role-based access control with permissions
- [ ] Add audit logging and user actions
- [ ] Connect Prometheus/Grafana for observability
- [ ] Add centralized logging with ELK or Loki
